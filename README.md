## Introduction
Welcome to my final project! In this project, I'll be analyzing the **Global Superstore** dataset to uncover valuable insights. The dataset represents a *fictional global online retailer* based in New York, known as Global Superstore. With customers from 147 different countries and a vast product catalog consisting of over 10,000 items across office supplies, furniture, and technology categories, there's a wealth of data to explore. Join me as I dive into the data and extract meaningful insights to improve performance and profitability for Global Superstore.

## Problem Statement
To help Global Superstore analyze and draw out meaningful insight from the Superstore dataset which would aid management in making informed decisions to improve performance and profitability by. finding solution to the following questions.

### Question 1.
a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014? b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?

### Question 2.
a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.

### Question 3.
a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?
b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

### Question 4.
a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

### Question 5.
a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?

### Question 6.
a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

### Question 7.
a)Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?



## Skills/ Concepts demonstrated
The following Excel features were incorporated;
1. Fiters
2. Duplicate removal
3. Find and Replace
4. Dax
5. Pivot Tables

### Processes

I conducted a thorough data cleaning process in Excel to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. This involved removing duplicates, meticulously filtering each column to validate the data, and utilizing the 'Find and Replace' feature to address any blanks or misspellings. Additionally, I prudently eliminated unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset for analysis.

By leveraging Excel's built-in table functionality, I organized the data effectively, making it easier to manage and analyze. Furthermore, I standardized the date format across the dataset and employed Excel's powerful functions to extract and separate the year and month components from the 'Order_Date' column, enhancing data granularity.

## Data Visualization

I harnessed the power of PivotTables, enabling dynamic and interactive exploration of the dataset. To visualize key insights and trends, I utilized Excel's rich visualization tools to create informative dashboards, facilitating clear and concise communication of findings. This meticulous approach ensures that the data is not only clean and accurate but also actionable, empowering informed decision-making.
